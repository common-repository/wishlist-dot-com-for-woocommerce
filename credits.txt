## How WishList-dot-com-for-WooCommerce uses Joe Szalai's Exopite-Simple-Options-Framework
WishList-dot-com-for-WooCommerce's admin panel is based on Exopite-Simple-Options-Framework. Thank you, Joe Szalai.

## Exopite-Simple-Options-Framework has been modified the following ways:
1) To support Wordpress plugin requirements.
2) To smiplify the framework so it provides only what's required by WishList-dot-com-for-WooCommerce.
3) Functions and classes were prefixed with 'wldcfwc_', per Wordpress requirements.
